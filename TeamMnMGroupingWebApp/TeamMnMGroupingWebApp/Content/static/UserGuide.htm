	<h2> Introduction to the Student Grouping Tool</h2>

        <p>The Student Grouping Tool is intended for users who want to create and modify
        groups of students across the inBloom Data Store.</p>

        <p>The Student Grouping Tool is a flexible and intuitive application that
        allows staff with correct privileges to create and modify groups. These groups can then be selected to view information 
        about the students contained in the group.  There are several functions that can be performed on a group, such
        as adding a lesson plan or printing the students contained in the group.  The groups can
        be saved for future use, creating an easy-to-use tool that can quickly identify groups of students.</p>
            
        <p>Users have permissions assigned to them based on their role (i.e. Educator, IT Administrator). 
        Some actions are only available to users with Administrator privileges. As an example, IT Administrators 
        are able to create create and modify groups, where an Educator with default permissions will not have the required permissions. 
        This is an aspect to be aware of when trying to create or modify a group.</p>

        <p>For information about your current permission level, please contact your district administrator.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h5>How do I drag multiple students to a group?</h5>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
        <p>In order to drag and drop multiple
        students to a group you must select the checkbox inside the student box. Once
        all the students you want to drag are selected, drag them over to a group.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h5>Why does random mess up my current groups?</h5>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
        <p>Random reassigns every single
        student in the list into groups of the students. The number of students in each
        group is specified by the user. Students that have already been assigned to
        groups will be shuffled around and randomly assigned to other groups.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Why can't I change an existing group's name?</h5>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
        <p>Currently there is a limitation
        with the API that does not allow us to make changes to the group name.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>How many lesson plans can I attach to a group?</h5>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
        <p>One</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Why doesn't Save All work in IE9?</h5>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
        <p>IE9 does not support uploading multiple files, therefore when attempting
        to save more than one group with a file attachment, the Save All option will
        fail.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Where is the Save button on the Group Selection screen?</h5>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
        <p>The Save button will only appear if you have made changes to a group.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Why is there no student for me to select on the MultipleGroupEdit screen?</h5>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
        <p>There might not be any students associated with your school, please contact 
        your system admin to fix this issue.</p>

    <h2>Student Grouping Tool Tutorial</h2>
    
    <h3>Creating and Using Groups with a Sandbox Account</h3>

    <p>This is a brief tutorial to show a new user how to create and use groups with the Student Grouping Tool.</p>

    <p>After logging in to the inBloom Sandbox, the user will be prompted to select a sample dataset and a virtual Sandbox User.</p>
   
    <img src="./img/Dataset_and_User.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>

    <p>We recommend selecting the Small Sample Dataset from the list of sample datasets available.</p>

    <p><strong>If this is the user's first time using the Student Grouping Tool, the user must select a virtual 
    Sandbox User with administrative privileges in order to create student groups within the application.</strong></p>

    <p>Only virtual Sandbox Users with administrator privileges have the required permissions to create groups.
    Virtual Sandbox Users without administrator privileges can view groups that have previously been created;
    however, non-administrator virtual Sandbox Users cannot create, edit or delete groups.</p>

    <p>Select "Amy Kopal" from the list of available virtual Sandbox Users.</p>

    <table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Role</th>
                <th>Permission Level</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td >Charles Gray</td>
                <td >Educator</td>
                <td>Non-Administrator</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Linda Kim</td>
                <td>Educator</td>
                <td>Non-Administrator</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rebecca Braverman</td>
                <td>Educator</td>
                <td>Non-Administrator</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Maria Gonzales</td>
                <td>Leader</td>
                <td>Non-Administrator</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Amy Kopal</td>
                <td>IT Administrator</td>
                <td>Administrator</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mary Smith</td>
                <td>Aggregate Viewer</td>
                <td>Non-Administrator</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>

    <p>The user should choose a virtual Sandbox User based on the level of privileges the user needs 
    while using the Student Grouping Tool.  After the user has created sample groups, the user can select 
    a non-administrator Virtual Sandbox User from the table above.</p>
   
    <p>Administrator permission levels give the user the ability to create, edit and delete groups in 
    the Student Grouping Tool. Without administrator privileges, the user will be unable to create, edit 
    or delete groups within the Student Grouping Tool.</p>

    <h4>Creating a New Group</h4>

    <p>After selecting the sample dataset and virtual Sandbox User, the user will be redirected to the Student 
    Grouping Tool home page, also known as the Group Selection screen.</p>

    <img src="./img/group_selection_empty.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>

    <p>The Group Selection screen has two parts. The left side of the screen is reserved to list groups. Currently, there are no groups 
    to list. In order to create one or more groups, the user can enter the number of groups to create in the text field on the right 
    side of the screen and click the "create groups" button. The right side of the screen is for viewing and editing existing groups.</p>

    <img src="./img/creating_3_groups.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>

    <p>After clicking on the "create groups" button, the Student Grouping Tool will redirect the user to the Multiple 
    Group Edit screen. The three new groups are available to edit.</p>

    <img src="./img/multiple_group_edit_screen.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>

    <p>The Mulitple Group Edit screen has several parts. The following images and brief descriptions describe some fundamental 
    steps to creating and editing groups.</p>

    <img src="./img/add_students_to_groups.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>

    <p>Drag and drop the students on the left side of the screen in to their assigned group. The same student can be assigned to 
    multiple groups.</p>

    <img src="./img/change_group_names.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>

    <p>Click on the default group name and change the name to be more desciptive for the assigned group.</p>

   <img src="./img/save_individual_groups.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>

    <p>When scrolling over the group name, a list of three icons pop up. These icons can be used to perform actions 
    on an individual group. For example, this feature can be used to save an individual group, but not all of the groups.</p>

    <img src="./img/save_all.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>

    <p>Once the user has made all the changes needed, the "save all" button on the right side of the screen will 
    save all of the changes the user made to all of the groups.</p>

    <img src="./img/save_all_summary.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>

    <p>After the "save all" button is pressed, a summary box will notify the user if the groups were saved successfully 
    or if there were any issues that caused the groups to not be saved.</p>

    <img src="./img/back_button.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>

    <p>To return to the Group Selection screen, press the "back" button.</p>

    <img src="./img/group_selection_with_new_groups.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>

    <p>The three groups are now in the Group Selection List.</p>

    <img src="./img/group_selection_edit_ind_group.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>
   
    <p>To see the details of a group, a user can click on the group name. The details of the group are displayed on 
    the right side of the screen. An individual group can also be edited using this screen.</p>
